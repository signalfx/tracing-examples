# SignalFx Tracing Libraries

This repository contains example applications for some popular open source web
frameworks and libraries that have been auto-instrumented using a SignalFx Tracing
library for their respective platforms and languages.  It is meant as a potentially
more tangible introduction to getting starting with auto-instrumentation in your 
environment of choice than general documentation can sometimes be.

## SignalFx Tracing Supported Languages and Platforms
