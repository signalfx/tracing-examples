# ASP.NET Core and MongoDB Auto-Instrumentation Example

In this example, distributed traces are produced automatically using the
[Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-dotnet#splunk-distribution-of-opentelemetry-net).
Look at the
[HttpClient](../../../../shared/applications/dotnet/aspnetcore-and-mongodb/src/ClientExample/Program.cs)
and
[ASP.NET Core application](../../../../shared/applications/dotnet/aspnetcore-and-mongodb/src/AspNetCoreExample/Services/ItemService.cs)
source code.
Add the configuration of a CLR Profiler and the automatic instrumentation
to the respective [Dockerfile](./InstrumentContainer/Dockerfile)
to automatically instrument a simple inventory system.

## Building and running the example app and client

This multi-container application assumes you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and on your system.
To build and run the example services, clone this repository, move to this folder and from there do the following:

```sh
docker build ../../../../shared/applications/dotnet/aspnetcore-and-mongodb/src/AspNetCoreExample/ -t aspnetcore-and-mongodb-server-app
docker build ../../../../shared/applications/dotnet/aspnetcore-and-mongodb/src/ClientExample/ -t aspnetcore-and-mongodb-client-app
docker-compose build
SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access_token> SPLUNK_REALM=<realm> docker-compose up
```

The value for `SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN` can be found
[here](https://app.signalfx.com/o11y/#/organization/current?selectedKeyValue=sf_section:accesstokens).
Reference: [docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/authentication-tokens/api-access-tokens.html#admin-api-access-tokens).

The value for `SPLUNK_REALM` can be found
[here](https://app.signalfx.com/o11y/#/myprofile).
Reference: [docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/allow-services.html).

These commands will build the .NET projects and provide and coordinate their environments to create instrumented
request activity to be reported to Splunk Observability. The traced activity is initiated by the ExampleClient running through a
perpetual cycle of CRUD operations, which take place via the AspNetCoreExample ASP.NET Core application and its
associated MongoDB driver.

You can find the collected traces in Splunk Observability Cloud: <https://app.signalfx.com/#/apm?environments=YOURUSERNAME>

> Note: Processing might take some time.
