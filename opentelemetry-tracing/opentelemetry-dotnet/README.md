# OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation examples

This folder contains sample applications that were instrumented using
[OpenTelemetry .NET](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/net/).

You can instrument your application automatically or manually.
Automatic instrumentation doesn't require any source code changes.
Manual instrumentation requires adding and intializing the
[OpenTelemetry .NET SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry/README.md).
Follow the links below for examples of these two instrumentation modes:

- [Automatic](./automatic/README.md) currently in beta.
- [Manual](./manual/README.md) stable.
