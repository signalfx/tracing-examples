# SignalFx Distributed Tracing Instrumentation

## Instrumentation Agnostic

SignalFx Distributed Tracing intends to be instrumentation agnostic; supporting
& ingesting variety of popular open instrumentation libraries including 
[OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/), [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) &
[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/). So long as the tracer configured to send spans to
SignalFx ingest endpoint uses the Zipkin v1/2 JSON wire format or Jaeger Thrift
format, we will accept spans irrespective of how they were instrumented - via
one of the above mentioned open libraries or a homegrown one. Our goal is to
build on the shoulders of giant communities rather than re-invent the wheel with
proprietary libraries/agents and give customers choice to decide what works for
them without worrying about vendor lock-in.

For customers who have not yet instrumented their code, our default
recommendation is to use OpenTracing to instrument since it has a growing
ecosystem of library owners & frameworks instrumenting their code with it & use
Jaeger tracer libraries to export spans to us - both of these are CNCF projects
with a rapidly growing community behind them.

## How should I go about instrumenting my application for distributed tracing?
RPC layer(s) and service/web framework(s) are the best places to start when thinking about
how to go about instrumentating your application - both of these will likely have 
a large coverage area and touch a significant number of transaction paths to give
you baseline tracing coverage and visualize an end-to-end trace with a service-map.

Next you should identify services critical to your business and look for areas 
not covered by rpc or service/web frameworks. Within these services, identify high value
transactions and critical paths - instrument enough of these.

## Examples

This repository contains a set of simple example applications that demonstrate
using SignalFx with various open source tracers.  They are broken down by
language/platform.

### Java

- [Jaeger Java](./jaeger-java): our recommended tracer for Java.
- [Zipkin Brave](./zipkin-brave-java): Zipkin's instrumentation library for
  Java.
- [Java Kafka tracing](./opentracing-kafka-java): an example of tracing Kafka
  using Zipkin Brave with OpenTracing bindings.
- Spring Boot Examples:
  - [Jaeger Spring Boot](./jaeger-java-spring-boot-web): An example of instrumenting a Spring Boot application with Jaeger
  - [Zipkin Brave Spring Boot](./zipkin-brave-java-spring-boot-web): An example of instrumenting a Spring Boot application with Zipkin
  - [OpenCensus Spring Boot](./opencensus-jaeger-java-spring-boot): An example using the OpenCensus project's Jaeger exporter for java.

### Python

- [Jaeger Python](./jaeger-python): our recommended tracer for Python.
- [OpenCensus Python](./opencensus-jaeger-python): OpenCensus's instrumentation
  library with a Jaeger reporter in Python.

### Go

- [Jaeger Go](./jaeger-go): our recommended tracer for Golang.
- [OpenCensus Go](./opencensus-jaeger-go): OpenCensus's instrumentation library
  with a Jaeger reporter in Golang.

### Node.js

- [Jaeger Node.js](./jaeger-nodejs)
- [Zipkin JS Tracer](./zipkin-js): Zipkin's instrumentation library for
  Javascript (currently supports a broader range of instrumentations than the
  Jaeger Node tracer and supports running in a browser).

### Ruby

- [Jaeger Ruby](./jaeger-ruby): a Jaeger trace exporter for Ruby


### Service Meshes

- Istio
  - [Istio Mixer Adapter](./istio): We have an out of process adapter available for Istio.
    This is an example configuration for that adapter.
  - [Istio E-Commerce Application](./service-mesh/istio): An example application
    with Istio tracing using the SignalFx adapter and Envoy tracing.
- [Envoy](./envoy): the Envoy proxy can be configured to report trace spans to
  SignalFx.

### AWS Lambda Functions

- [AWS Lambda](./aws-lambda): Examples for instrumenting spans for AWS Lambda written in Java, Python, Node, Go


## Auto-Instrumentation

For customers who have not instrumented their applications, or have done so in an OpenTracing-compatible
fashion, we offer several SignalFx Tracing libraries.  Their detailed documentation is available in their
respective source locations:

- [Java](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-java-tracing)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-nodejs-tracing)
- [Python](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-python-tracing)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-ruby-tracing)

Please note these offerings are currently in Beta status.
